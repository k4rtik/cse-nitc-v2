      <h2>Profile</h2>
      <p>
The Department of Computer Science &amp; Engineering was started in June 1997 after trifurcating from the Department of Electrical Engineering. The department offers both <em>post graduate and undergraduate programmes in Computer Science &amp; Engineering, MCA programme</em> and <em>regular and part time doctoral degree programmes</em>.
      </p>
  
      <p>
The fast changing scenario in the Information Technology necessitates the Department to actively extend its research and development activities. The current research focus is on areas like <em>Image Processing, Mobile  Networks, Information Security, Compilers, Computer Architecture, Distributed Systems, Computational Intelligence</em> and <em>Multi Agent Systems</em>.
      </p>
  
      <p>
The department has five separate research labs, common laboratories with state of the art computing facilities and a department library with reference books and other research materials. Being a forerunner in the field, the Department is constantly modernizing its facilities to adapt itself to the rapidly changing technological scenario.
      </p>

      <h2>Mission and Vision</h2>

      <h2>Why our Department?</h2>
      <p>
This is what <a href="http://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/dheeraj/">Dheeraj Sanghi</a>, Professor, CSE Deaprtment, IIT Kanpur and Director, LNM Institute of Information Technology, Jaipur has to say about the department and NIT Calicut:
      </p>
      <blockquote cite="http://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/dheeraj/ideas/csdept.html">
        <p>
In September 2006, I had a chance to visit <em>NIT Calicut</em>, and I must say that I was very impressed. As you can see from the short list of colleges on this page, I do not get impressed easily. And let me tell you why. The first thing I noticed was that pretty much every faculty member in the <em>[CSE]</em> department had a degree from either an IIT or IISc. They do hire people who have a B.Tech. degree, but then ask them to do graduate education from outside. In most colleges, they run graduate programs (MTech or PhD) primarily to ensure that their own faculty members can get part-time graduate degrees. But this in-breeding is dangerous for the quality of a department. The maintenance of the campus is another thing that struck me as something great. In many campuses I see buildings in black or green colour because of what they will like to claim is heavy rain. But NITC, all the buildings looked good from the outside, and I was told that they put a coat of paint frequently to ensure that the buildings do not look ugly. The infrastructure is very good, and is one of the few colleges who have actually used up the grants given to them under the TEQUIP program. The faculty is very cohesive. They have resisted the temptation of starting a program on IT. (Why shouldn't CSE and IT departments be merged in all NITs? There is hardly any difference in the programs, and these differences can be handled by offering electives.)
